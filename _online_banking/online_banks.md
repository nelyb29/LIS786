Some banks operate exclusively online, with no physical branch. These banks handle customer service by phone, email, or online chat. Online banking is frequently performed on mobile devices now that Wi-Fi and 4G networks are widely available. It can also be done on a desktop computer.

These banks may not provide direct automatic teller machine (ATM) access but will make provisions for consumers to use ATMs at other banks and retail stores. They may reimburse consumers for some of the ATM fees charged by other financial institutions. Reduced overhead costs associated with not having physical branches typically allow online banks to offer consumers significant savings on banking fees. They also offer higher interest rates on accounts.

Prominent online banks in the United States include Ally Bank, Bank5 Connect, Discover Bank, and Synchrony Bank.

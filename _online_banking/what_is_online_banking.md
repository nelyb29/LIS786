Online banking allows a user to conduct financial transactions via the Internet. Online banking is also known as Internet banking or web banking.

Online banking offers customers almost every service traditionally available through a local branch including deposits, transfers, and online bill payments. Virtually every banking institution has some form of online banking, available both on desktop versions and through mobile apps.

  KEY TAKEAWAYS
    -Online banking allows a user to conduct financial transactions via the Internet.
    -Consumers aren't required to visit a bank branch in order to complete most of their basic banking transactions.
    -A customer needs a device, an Internet connection, and a bank card to register. Once registered, the consumer sets up a password to begin using the service.
